# AMD GFX Drivers Forum For Vulkan&reg; and OpenGL&reg;
This repo works as a forum to replace the prior AMD Community [DevGuru](https://community.amd.com/t5/developers/ct-p/devguru). The primary goal is to support developers using Vulkan and OpenGL APIs on top of AMD GPUs.
The ["Issues"](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMD-Gfx-Drivers/issues) tab is for posting issues/bugs you run into, and the ["Discussion"](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMD-Gfx-Drivers/discussions) tab is for posting feature requests or questions with regard to Vulkan and OpenGL drivers and APIs. Given this repo is primarily serving as a forum for Vulkan and OpenGL, if you bring up any issues/bugs/feature requests pertinent to other graphics APIs we may need to redirect them to different channels to address your asks.
# How to post an issue or discussion
## Please:
- Search this forum for existing issues or discussions which may contain a solution to your topic before creating a new one.
- Use a title that accurately describes your issue. Do NOT use titles like "Help Me" or "Driver issue".
- Post your issues or discussions in the appropriate tab for a quicker and more insightful responses.
- When creating a new issue, please provide as many details as possible describing your issue, including the steps to reproduce the issue.
- It is highly recommended and appreciated to provide a standalone simple sample to reproduce your issue if the original content is not easy to access or the issue itself is too complicated to be reproduced.
## Describe your system HW/SW configurations:
Use some useful tools to collect your system's HW/SW configuration data and provide those system information along with your issue reporting, which will greatly help us triage and reproduce your issue.
- On Windows, you may use "DxDiag” or “SystemInfo", etc.
- On Linux, you may attach the "dmesg" log, output of "lscpu", "lspci", "dmidecode", etc.
## Describe your issue:
- Provide a detailed description of the issue you are experiencing, and the steps required to reproduce the issue.
- Details about applications/games affected (including version number)
- Graphical settings used in the application/game (resolution and 3D settings)
- If possible, attach a screenshot or video link to showcase the issue symptoms
- Any helpful information such as logs, dumps, code snippets and shader samples may also be included.
