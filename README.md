# AMD GFX Drivers Forum For Vulkan&reg; and OpenGL&reg;
This repro works as a forum to replace the prior AMD Community [DevGuru](https://community.amd.com/t5/developers/ct-p/devguru). The primary goal is to support developers using Vulkan and OpenGL APIs on top of AMD GPUs.
The ["issues"](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMD-Gfx-Drivers/issues) tab is for posting issues/bugs you run into, and the ["discussion"](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMD-Gfx-Drivers/discussions) tab is for posting feature requests or questions regarding Vulkan and OpenGL APIs. You may put issues/bugs/feature requests for other GPU related APIs but we may need to redirect them to different channels to handle.
# How to post an issue or discussion
## Please:
- Search the forum for existing issues or discussions which may contain a solution to your topic before creating a new one.
- Use a title that accurately summarizes your issue. Do not use titles like "Help Me" or "Driver issue".
- Post your issue or discussion in the appropriate tab for a faster and more helpful response.
- When creating a new issue, please provide as much details as possible describing your issue, including the steps to reproduce the issue.
- It will be highly appreciated to provide a standalone simple sample if the original content is not easy to access or the issue itself is complicated to be reproduced.
## Describe your system HW/SW configuration:
Use any tools to collect the system's HW/SW configuration data and attach the text information with the issue. 
- On Windows, you may use "DxDiag” or “SystemInfo", etc.
- On Linux, you may attach the "dmesg" log, output of "lscpu", "lspci", "dmidecode", etc.
## Describe your issue:
- Provide a detailed description of the issue you are experiencing, and the steps required to reproduce the issue.
- Details about applications/games affected (including version number)
- Graphical settings used in the application/game (resolution and 3D settings)
- If possible, include a screenshot or video link of the issue.
- Any helpful information such as logs, dumps and code may also be included.
